## Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for Image Classification

This repository contains code for a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implemented in TensorFlow/Keras for image classification. The code includes data preprocessing, model definition, training, and graphical analysis.

## Overview

The code is structured into the following main sections:

1. **Data Preparation:**
   - The dataset is assumed to be organized into a main folder containing subfolders for training and validation data.
   - ImageDataGenerator is used to preprocess and augment the image data.
   - The data is split into training and validation sets.

2. **Model Architecture:**
   - The neural network architecture is a simple CNN.
   - The architecture includes Conv2D layers, MaxPooling2D layers, Flatten layer, Dense layers, and Dropout for regularization.

3. **Model Compilation:**
   - The model is compiled using the Adam optimizer, categorical crossentropy loss (assuming multiclass classification), and accuracy as the evaluation metric.

4. **Model Training:**
   - The model is trained using the preprocessed image dataset.
   - Training progress is monitored, and the model is evaluated on the validation set.
   - The training history is stored for further analysis.

5. **Graphical Analysis:**
   - Graphs of training and validation accuracy and loss over epochs are generated using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
   - These visualizations help assess the model's performance and identify overfitting or underfitting.
